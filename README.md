# Data Analytics Course - IIT Madras

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Analytics course repository! This repository contains assignments where various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc., are applied to different datasets. Additionally, technical papers accompany each assignment, providing in-depth explanations of the algorithms, data, models, performance metrics, and results.

## Technical Papers

Each assignment is accompanied by a detailed technical paper that follows the standard format for research papers. The structure includes:

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the algorithm and its relevance.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**
   - Detailed explanation of the applied algorithm, including mathematical formulations.

3. **Dataset Description**
   - Overview of the dataset used, including data sources and features.

4. **Model Implementation**
   - Detailed steps on how the algorithm was implemented for the specific dataset.

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - Discussion on the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

6. **Results and Analysis**
   - Presentation of results and in-depth analysis of the model's performance.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of findings and potential areas for improvement.

## Code Notebooks

The code notebooks associated with each assignment provide hands-on implementation details. You can run these notebooks to reproduce the results and explore the code.
