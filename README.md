 Course undertaken under Prof Gaurav Raina

Overview
Welcome to the Data Analytics course repository! This repository contains assignments where various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc., are applied to different datasets. Additionally, technical papers accompany each assignment, providing in-depth explanations of the algorithms, data, models, performance metrics, and results.


 
Technical Papers
Each assignment is accompanied by a detailed technical paper that follows the standard format for research papers. The structure includes:

Introduction

Brief overview of the algorithm and its relevance.
Algorithm Explanation

Detailed explanation of the applied algorithm, including mathematical formulations.
Dataset Description

Overview of the dataset used, including data sources and features.
Model Implementation

Detailed steps on how the algorithm was implemented for the specific dataset.
Performance Metrics

Discussion on the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
Results and Analysis

Presentation of results and in-depth analysis of the model's performance.
Conclusion

Summary of findings and potential areas for improvement.
Code Notebooks
The code notebooks associated with each assignment provide hands-on implementation details. You can run these notebooks to reproduce the results and explore the code.
